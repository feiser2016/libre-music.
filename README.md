### What is this repository for? ###

Libre Music is a FOSS media player application for Android with support for reading CUE sheets.
The application supports Android Lollipop and above.

Libre Music is written in Kotlin (Aside from DB folder), uses GreenDAO 3 ORM for the Database and
Glide for picture loading.

This repository is for those who want an easy, free solution for a media player that can read cue sheets as well as
files with embedded cue sheets and is also fast and practical to use.

### How do I get set up? ###

Do a checkout of the repository in Android Studio.
Make sure you have the Kotlin plugin installed (If you don't have Android Studio 3 and above)
and of course the latest SDK available, because I'll be updating the SDK and the libraries as
often as I can.
